    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Mussels have a wonderful savory briny ocean flavor and are inexpensive compared to oysters or clams. 
        Belgian beer adds a nice earthy flavor. We throw in some smoked ham, garlic, and fresh herbs to create a delicious appetizer for your guests.  
        Add bread and a green salad for a complete meal.
    </p>
    <p>Buy fresh mussels and use within a day of purchase. Choose mussels with a tightly closed shell and discard any 
        with chipped or broken shells. Wrap in moist paper towels and refrigerate when you get them home.
